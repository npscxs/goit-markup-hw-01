  <h1 class="page-title">Planet Fatness</h1>
  <p>
    Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to start
    - people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy, overweight
    and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress, those
    healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another planet. On their
    planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza was OK and
    jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost 100 pounds and
    completely changed my diet, I still believe we WERE on different planets.
    The thing is that once I escaped.

      How to stop doubting and start exercising regularly
    </h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      Thousands of people dream about having a nice body. They start doing
      sport, face challenges and quit it in a few weeks or even days. Why does
      it happen? The problem is that people often do too much physical activity
      when their body is not ready for this load. Without allowing any recovery
      time between exercise sessions, they get tired quickly and lose
      motivation. We believe that you should have a smooth start and focus on
      developing a habit of doing sport regularly. So, we offer you a few
      training programs for beginners.
