<p>
  Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to start -
  people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy, overweight and
  depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress, those
  healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another planet. On their
  planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza was OK and
  jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost 100 pounds and
  completely changed my diet, I still believe we WERE on different planets. The
  thing is that once I escaped.

<h2 id="programs">How to stop doubting and start exercising regularly</h2>
<p>
  Thousands of people dream about having a nice body. They start doing sport,
  face challenges and quit it in a few weeks or even days. Why does it happen?
  The problem is that people often do too much physical activity when their body
  is not ready for this load. Without allowing any recovery time between
  exercise sessions, they get tired quickly and lose motivation. We believe that
  you should have a smooth start and focus on developing a habit of doing sport
  regularly. So, we offer you a few training programs for beginners.
